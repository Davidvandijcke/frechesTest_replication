Description: Implements an ANOVA-style test for detecting discontinuities (jumps)
    in the conditional Frechet mean of random objects valued in arbitrary metric 
    spaces. Supports probability distributions (Wasserstein distance), covariance/
    correlation matrices, spherical data (geodesic distance), and network Laplacians.
    The methodology is based on "A Test for Jumps in Metric-Space Conditional Means" 
    by David Van Dijcke. Includes automatic bandwidth selection via cross-validation
    and handles various metric space geometries through the Frechet mean framework.
